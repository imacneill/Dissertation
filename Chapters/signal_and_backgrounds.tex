\chapter{Signal and Backgrounds}
The previous section described how fundamental particles are reconstructed within the CMS detector. While seeking to measure the production of a certain set of particles, it is important to understand how those pieces in aggregate demonstrate the presence of that production. It is just as important to understand what other types of productions will appear to be the what is being sought while not actually coming from the specific particles desired. The following chapter describes what the \ttZ signature looks like and how false positives appear like the \ttZ signature.\\
