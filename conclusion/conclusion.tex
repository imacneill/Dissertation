This dissertation presents the measurement of the cross section of associated production of top anti-top pairs with Z bosons at $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$. The measurement is an inclusive search performed in a tri-lepton final state. In \intLumi of data, the cross section for \ttZ \ production is measured as $\sigma=194 _{-89} ^{+105}$ \ fb with a significance of 2.33. Finally, the ratio of measured to theoretical cross section is $0.94_{-0.43} ^{+0.51}$.
